// Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code.
//These are imported and used in other Sass files. ames for partials start with the underscore (_) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. 
// Also, Sass files end with the .scss file extension. To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use the @import directive.

// In the main.scss file 


//_partials.scss .  , when import though @import 'partials'

@import 'variables'
